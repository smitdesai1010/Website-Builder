# Website-Builder
This is one the concept projects i did during my high school.
The program i coded in C++ entirely.

The program allows the users to build and design static websites.
Users can add a variety of different HTML tags for their website in any order.

Once the user has finished adding text, he/she can start styling it by choosing from a
variety of different options.It allows the users to add their own styling options.

Once completed, then the user can vuew the website by launching it from the program.
The website and the added styling options are saved for later use.
